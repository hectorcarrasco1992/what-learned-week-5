###  Booleans

    Learned about booleans and their uses. They essentially are true or false values where we can determine what will get returned from the function based on whether certain values are true or false.

### FizzBUzz

did an exercise where we must determine true or false if a number is divisible by 5 or 3. Depending on the outcome it returns either fizz or buzz. If it is divisible by both it returns FIzzBUzz.

### Iffy

Created a Node app based around Booleans. These apps were able to take user input in the terminal and return results based on functions written. Mostly used turneries to code it.
